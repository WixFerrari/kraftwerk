# Coupon Acceptance Analysis
The goal for the student was to use what was learned to analyze which customers are likely to accept a coupon and which are not.

# Key Findings:
* Females have an acceptance rate of 49.26%, Males have an acceptance rate of 50.44%
* Males below 21 have the highest acceptance rate at 83.2%
* Males over 50 had the lowest at 41.5%
* Divorced males had the highest rate at 60.0%
* Widowed males had the lowest at 29.4%
* Females who visit the coffee house 4-8 times a month have the highest acceptance rate at 69.0%
* Females who never visit the coffee house have the lowest rate at 16.6%

# Summary:
Based off the multiple simulations, there are many observations that can be made about coffee house coupon acceptance rates. First off, the proportion accepted for coffee house coupons was calculated to be 49.84%. I then separated by gender and found that females have a total acceptance rate of 49.26%, while males had a slighty higher rate of 50.44%.

In my second simulation, I chose to find the acceptance rate in regards to gender and age. Males under 21 have a crazy acceptance rate of 83.2%, 46 year old males are second at 59.6% while every other category hovers around 50%. I did the same for gender and marital status, divorced males were found to have the highest rate at 60%, while unmarried partner females have the highest at 52.6%. Widowed males also had the lowest acceptance rate at 29.4%.

Finally, I did one with gender and coffee house visits and found that males and females who visit the coffee house 4-8 times a month have the highest proportion acceptance rates at 69.0% and 68.2%. It seems like besides the people that never go to coffee houses and females who go less than 1 times a month, everyone else has an proportional acceptance rate over 50%.

# Next Step/Recommendations:

The next step would be to go into more detail and include variables such as time, destination, weather, and temperature.

When it comes to recommendations, I feel that there are better ways to clean the data that could give a better result.
